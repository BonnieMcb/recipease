![Responsive](...)    
    
The brief for this third Milestone project was to ..............make a responsive and dynamic website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. CRUD .............It is the third of four projects as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

## Project Overview
The Recipease recipe website was created first and foremost as a way to fulfill the requirements of the CI project brief. One of the example projects for the project brief was a recipe website. I decided to go with an example project this time, because with my last two projects I learnt that I am able to spend a long time deciding on what to make and I didn't want to waste valueble time deciding while I could be actually building the site instead. I once again took inspiration from my own life to differentiate the website a little. This website focuses on users who have allergies in their families.
Recipease was built using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/), which is a document-based database for the storing and retrieving data.

## UX (User Experience)

### Goals
The Recipease website is a web application where users are able to add and store their own recipes, as well as view recipes added by others. It is designed with users in mind who have multiple allergens in their family or friend circle. 

#### Basic Goals
Users visiting this site will be able to:
- Register an account
- Log in and out
- See a list of all recipes on the database
- Registered users who have clicked on their allergens when registering will not see recipes containing those allergens
- Filter the recipes by both allergens (multiple selection available) and dish category
- View the details of the recipes
- Add a recipe (registered user only)
- Edit recipes that they have added (registered user only)
- View a list of recipes they have added (registered user only)
- Share a recipe?????????????//
- Visit the shop page??????????????

#### Stretch Goals
With time and resources allowing, other goals are to:
- Favourites

#### Future ideas for new features
- For the bird category in learning mode, have the modal play a soundfile of the noise the bird makes upon matching a pair.
- Have a collection of different facts in a json file and display a random one upon matching a pair instead of always the same one. This would increase replayability value.


### User Stories

1. I am looking for a one stop place to add, edit and view my own recipes.
2. I want to view recipes and know that I won't see recipes with my allergens in them.
3. I am throwing a dinner party and my friends have an assorted collection of allergies. I want to find a recipe for every course to satisfy all their requirements.

### Design









materialize css
jquery


08/12/20 Gitpod was having some outage issues, also noted by CI. Seems one of my pushes did not go through.

TODO:
Figure out checkboxes on Add recipe

nice TODO:
only show favourite buttons when logged in OR 
    flash message/tooltip(Materialize) that one must be logged in to save to favourites

testing while coding for example:
flash("Permission to edit")
write about user provided input validation / access permissions etc


attributes:
