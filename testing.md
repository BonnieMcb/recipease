### Validator Checks

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page (apart from the ones where you need to be logged in) of the project to ensure there was no invalid code in the various languages used. There were some errors initially, but these were fixed and detailed in the commit history.

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) No errors.
- [JsHint](https://jshint.com/) (0 warnings)
- [PEP-8 checker](http://pep8online.com/)(All right)
